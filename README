Victoria University EES4100 Test Suite

First and foremost this project has been developed as an assessment relevant to my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at Victoria University. This code is most likely incomplete or inefficient, use at your own peril. 

System works to a degree got bouncing back and fourth but no integers?

To use program run the bacnet_server and with a little luck all will connect a ok.

The system was based on a testbench setup by my tutor Kim Taylor, this is located at https://github.com/kmtaylor/EES4100_Testbench

This repository builds three applications:

bacnet_client:
    This application will continually poll for devices with subdirectories in
    RANDOM_DATA_POOL. Once a device has been found, it will send a
    Read_Property request to as many Analog_Input object instances as required
    by the data in the device's RANDOM_DATA_POOL.

    bacnet_client acts as a BBMD and expects register_with_bbmd requests.

bacnet_server:
    An incomplete implementation of a Modbus to BACnet bridge. (The modbus code is half complete). Use this as a basis for your project.

    It is currently configured to send test_data (matching the data for device
    90 in RANDOM_DATA_POOL) to demonstrate the matching requirements for
    bacnet_client.

modbus_server:
    The Modbus server that expects connections from bacnet_server. It will
    provide data as provided by RANDOM_DATA_POOL. The BACnet device number to
    register number mapping is as follows:
	
	BACnet Side			Modbus Side

	Device 13 AI Instance 0		Register 13
	Device 13 AI Instance 1		Register 14
	Device 13 AI Instance 2		Register 15
	Device 130 AI Instance 0	Register 130

	Device 90 AI Instance 0		Register 90
	Device 90 AI Instance 1		Register 91
	Device 90 AI Instance 2		Register 92
	Device 90 AI Instance 3		Register 93

BUILDING THE SYSTEM

too build the system follow these easy steps:
Step 1: git clone https://github.com/keithy27/EES4100_Testbench.git
Step 2: ./bootstrap.sh
Step 3: ./configure
Step 4: make

If this fails, refer to autotools manual located at: https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html
